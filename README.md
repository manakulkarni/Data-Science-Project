This is my exploratory analysis of Flavors of my city


Flavors of My City is an Indian online retail business
focusing primarily on delivering region-specific delicacies to
other parts of India. Their business model is based on creating tie
ups with third party vendors of a specific region, so that they can
deliver delicacies to other states/regions. As they are scaling up in
terms of products, customers and services, their data is
increasing massively. In such a scenario, we strongly feel that
statistical analysis of their data can help find insights which will
enhance the older business model. We decided to take the data
that came primarily from four segments: Products, Customers,
Regions and Web Traffic.


Typically e-commerce datasets are proprietary and consequently
hard to find among publicly available data. This dataset contains
real world data. We will not only perform our analyses but also
advise the ‘Flavors of my city’, with our findings and provide
recommendations for scaling up their business. Our research
intends to understand trends and patterns between different
characteristics of their data and develop inferences from them .
These can help the company improve their supply chain and
better manage their inventory. 

This analysis would also give us
an idea of the shopping patterns, on the basis of which, the
business can derive smarter promotions. We performed
exploratory and predictive analytics on transactional data
provided to us from the business owners of Flavours of My City
and on the basis of our analysis we came up with the following
recommendations:
1)Diverting metropolitan customers to online channel.
2)Improving sales and marketing strategies for juices.
3)Predicting inventory & maintaining a smart catalogue for
festivals.
4)Driving sales with personalized recommendations.
